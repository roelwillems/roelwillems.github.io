         	<p>Today I have received the Wacom Intuos Pro Medium. First impressions are very good, as expected.</p>

<p>It will take a bit more time to get used to the large surface area (vs the small size Wacom tablet I used before).</p>

<p>The one thing that bugs me is that Adobe Lightroom Classic and Windows 10 Ink doesn&rsquo;t play nicely together. To get the pen working properly with sliders in the interface I have to prohibit Wacom from using the Windows 10 Ink features. This results in sliders works perfectly but losing out on presure sensitivity. This is a bug since 2015 (really Adobe? It works fine in Photoshop&hellip;).</p>

<p>I might have found a work-around but need some more testing tomorrow. Signing off for today.</p>

         	<p>1Password is acting strange every since I&rsquo;ve installed Big Sur. Somehow the browser plugin isn&rsquo;t working. First I thought the issue was with Safari but also Firefox has the same issue. Need to look in to this more later today.</p>

         	<p>For our peace of mind, a few months ago we installed a burglar alarm. Out of nowhere, the alarm went off last night. The tampering/jamming checks got triggered by an outage at our internet provider. Quite a rude awakening but luckily nothing serious.</p>

         	<p>The Wacom Bamboo Pen and Touch (CTT-460 to be specific) is over 11 years old. Still working (although on Big Sur the hack to load the old drivers no longer works). Besides that, the only problem in 11 years is losing (and rediscovering) the pen so many times I have lost count.</p>

         	<p>Ever since Spotify launched in The Netherlands I have been a subscriber (even before the official launch&hellip; but let&rsquo;s not tell Spotify). But now music discovery and keeping everything organized is getting harder by the day. These issues small and not real dealbreakers, but still&hellip;</p>

<p>My 60+ playlists (educated guess, didn&rsquo;t want to count) are a hot mess of curated lists and my lists (with no way of keeping them separate). I have lists based on genre, new finds, based on band, albums, list where I store all-time favorites, &hellip;.. (sometimes even creatively combined).
So if I want to find a specific artist/track and I don&rsquo;t recall the name I have to start guessing in which playlist I may have saved the song. This wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if I would know which playlists are mine and which are curated by the service. Well I just have to open them all and start looking&hellip; wait&hellip; was &ldquo;90s acoustic&rdquo; my own or is it by Spotify??</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Made for You&rdquo; part has gradually starting to offer me more of the music I already listen to&hellip; just split in more different playlists.</p>

<p>What also doesn&rsquo;t help is that the play and search history isn&rsquo;t synced between apps and desktop. And don&rsquo;t ask me why the homepage only shows &ldquo;Recently Played&rdquo; playlists but leaves out individual tracks??
Earlier today I couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of a new artist I listened to the day before and wanted to check out. Spend half an hour to find the track I listened to (was well hidden in the search on the iOS app so showed no trace on desktop).</p>

<p>At the moment I do not have a solution for the issues above. And don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still enjoy the service,  just getting my thoughts out there for future reference.</p>

<ol>
<li>Scaled and compressed all images, resizing and reuploading isn&rsquo;t the most inspiering to do, but still it counted for 90% of the bloat in size (and my website isn&rsquo;t even very image heavy)</li>
<li>Removed the Gravatar integration with a static favicon and header image. Gravatar isn&rsquo;t privacy-friendly at all and the standard integration within Micro.blog is quite unneccesary. So win for privacy and reduced one request</li>
<li>Stopped using the custom CSS function within Micro.blog and just added all to the the custom theme CSS, saving one request</li>

         	<p>The word <em>dependence</em> often has a negative connotation to it. For me, it also signals something positive more in line with &ldquo;reliance&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to be independent. As long as you keep in mind that sometimes you need the help of others, as others might someday need to rely on you.</p>

<p><em>This guide works for files without images and Ulysses specific bells and whistles</em></p>

<ol>

<li>Open Ulysses on your Mac and add the “Ulysses export” folder to the library (bottom of the left sidebar) → Add External Folder;</li>
<li>Select the files you would like to export from Ulysses to standard Markdown;</li>
<li>Move the files, within Ulysses, to the “Ulysses export”  folder;</li>
<li>Open the “Ulysses export” folder in the Finder and move/import to where ever you would like.</li>

<li id="fn:1">Just trying to backup the .ulysses files isn&rsquo;t very useful as the .ulysses files have a hash for a name and contain two files (Content.xml and Text.txt).

         	<p>I like words. I like plain and simple thoughts and stories written down.
For as long as the internet existed it has been a great place to read and write.</p>

<p>But while the web has been ever increasingly gaining advancements in design and complexity, I value&hellip; no, I crave, simplicity.</p>

<p>Almost all of the web today is geared toward gaining attention and <em>eyeballs</em>. Every year, with every advancement, I feel we distance ourselves more and more from what is really valuable for these mere <em>eyeballs</em> (also known as humans).</p>

<p>At most websites, you have to click through a jungle of stuff which only distracts from their main objective (just to name a few: Medium, Youtube and almost all news outlets on the web).
And although I fully understand the business objectives driving these decisions, I feel there is a quality to simplicity and not being over-designed. In my opinion, it adds character.</p>

<p>Most of the time your message will not be more clearly expressed when surrounded by fancy stuff let alone a bombardment of ads and messages.</p>

<p>Plain words on a plain website are in my opinion just like a vinyl record. And just like for people enjoy listening to a vinyl record, it&rsquo;s not about audio perfection or having all bells and whistles. It&rsquo;s completely the opposite.</p>

<p>To take the music analogy a step future. A super clean production of a mediocre song can become a hit (with the right number of infuencers and paid-airtime), but be all forgotten about in a year or so. &ldquo;Perfection&rdquo; gets boring most often.
The song that an artist (possibly with less vocal quality or marketing budget) just had to put out there has the potential to become legendary. Because it has meaning and its roughness only adds to its quality.</p>

<p>With words, like music, it’s also not about perfection but about meaning.</p>

<p>When writing we should feel like an artist making a song. Making a song, not because it will show our vocal capabilities best, but because it’s a song that has to be made, has to be heard.</p>

<p>The same goes for words, the beauty is in meaning. Just feel free to write.</p>

<p><em>This post is as much reminding myself that my writing doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect as supporting everyone reading this to just write down what you feel you have to say!</em></p>

<p>In a Tuesday interview with CNN, Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook&rsquo;s handling of recent scandals and his own leadership of the company. He flatly rejected calls to give up his position as the chairman of Facebook&rsquo;s board and said he had no plans to fire his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg.</p>

<p>People like to mock Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; slogan, but the company really has made difficult calls in the past—like pulling out of China over pressure to build a censored search engine.</p>

<p>The other day I had to log in to a service I hadn’t used before. Since I was a new user, the website decided that it needed to check that I wasn’t a robot and so set me a Captcha (Completely Automated Public <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> to tell Computers and Humans Apart). This is a challenge-response test to enable a computer to determine whether the user is a person rather than a machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>But note also the delicious additional irony that the Captcha is described as an “automated Turing test”. The Turing test was conceived, you may recall, as a way of enabling humans to determine whether a machine could respond in such a way that one couldn’t tell whether it was a human or a robot. So we have wandered into a topsy-turvy world in which machines make us jump through hoops to prove that we are humans!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it’s clearly human ingenuity transforming us to unpaid “click workers” training A.I, but regardless it&rsquo;s still a very interesting case.</p>

<p>It makes you wonder what could happen if an A.I. would learn and deploy this on its own. And although I don’t think this would happen in the very near future, we should think about unforeseen consequences (as almost all technology and legislations bring in there wake).</p>

<p><em>P.S. Personally I find the types of CAPTCHAs presented to us very interesting. It gives insight in the current focus of developments in machine learning and A.I. Will be very interesting to see what will be next after road signs and store fronts.</em></p>

<p>This is a small guide (hence the category <a href="https://roelwillems.com/micro-guides/">&ldquo;micro guide&rdquo;</a>) to enable IPv6<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for your hosted microblog<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>disclaimer: please make sure that you know what you are doing with your DNS settings. Although it isn&rsquo;t really difficult or complex you can really mess up access to your website if the settings are incorrect. Please make note of the original settings before changing anything.</em></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-ipv6">Setting up IPv6</h3>

<p>To start, you should go to your domain registrar or system to manage DNS (personally I use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> and have written another micro guide with recommendations on how-to <a href="https://roelwillems.com/2018/04/16/micro-guide-additional.html">enable Cloudflare for your microblog</a>).</p>

<p>Now you can create an AAAA record (a record is an instruction for the browser to which server to connect and the AAAA version is used for IPv6 addresses).</p>

<p>Make sure that the AAAA record is pointing to:</p>

<pre><code>2600:3c00:1::68c8:16d6
</code></pre>

<p>This is the IPv6 address for hosted microblogs.
Leave the A record (address for IPv4) and other records like CNAME unaltered. Based on you DNS provider it should look somewhat like:</p>

<p><img src="https://roelwillems.com/uploads/2020/68e0b1b26f.png" alt="example of DNS records" /></p>

<p>Save the settings and after a few minutes you can <a href="https://www.internet.nl">check if your website has support for IPv6</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I always enjoy Ben en James talking business strategy in their <a href="http://exponent.fm">Exponent podcast</a> (Ben Thompson from <a href="https://stratechery.com">Stratechery</a> with co-host James Allworth). Their last podcast about Zillow (<a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-149-zillow-and-sustaining-aggregation/">#149 - Zillow and Sustaining Aggregation</a>) has a specific part really standing out. At 14:14 minutes in, James explains the difference between sustaining and disrupting innovation. And does so in very clear language.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the podcast (emphasis is mine):
&gt; James: It think what would be interesting here, just to drive home the point for people. Is to think about a technology right now and how it could be applied as a sustaining innovation and a disruptive innovation. It&rsquo;s been a less popular topic in the more recent Exponents but obviously, if you go back far enough, something we would talk a whole lot about is self-driving cars and the impact that&rsquo;s going to have on society.
&gt;
&gt; Now the technology is going to be the same if you are an existing manufacturer or something like Google, and maybe Google drops it into an existing manufacturer. This is a technology in and of itself business model agnostic, but you think about the incentives of different players and how they want to apply that technology. You give this to someone like BMW, an existing car manufacturer. And their instinct is to think; how can I take this technology and sell the vehicle that I have for more money as a result. And you get cool features like self-driving on Tesla or adaptive cruise control on BMW. <em>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</em> But it&rsquo;s fundamentally a sustaining innovation. This is exactly why self-driving vehicle; people love to talk about Tesla&rsquo;s disruptive, and maybe there is something in terms of the way they are thinking about building out a network and so on, this is true. But in terms of the actual vehicles, this is why Tesla vehicles are fundamentally not a disruptive product. <em>They are using a technology to sell a better product to the existing people for more money. It is fundamentally the same business model.</em> But take that to a very different context which is; <em>something like Uber or Lift, doing ride sharing. And their primary cost of business is paying for the drivers in the vehicles. And that is disruptive to the existing car manufacturers. Uber and lift want to take the self-driving technology and they are not going to take that and trying to sell the vehicles for more money as a result of it.</em> They are going to take the technology and use it to drive down the cost basis of offering ride sharing. <em>The same technology applied in fundamentally different ways, one is sustaining, one is disruptive.</em></p>

<p>Highly recommend listing if you care about online/tech business strategy.
James (and Ben) make a very compelling case that most (new) tech companies still running sustaining business models and most of them are in fact are no disrupters at all. Even if popular media will consistently describe them as &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Tesla is also a great explanatory case for disruption vs sustaining business models. The technology deployed by Tesla is very new (and Eldon&rsquo;s vision maybe futuristic) but in its basic form, Tesla tries to build (better) cars and sell them for profit.</p>

<p>My personal take out is: technology in and on itself isn&rsquo;t disruptive, the way technology is applied and to be more precise; the business model around it, make it disruptive for the status quo.
Based on the business model behind technology/innovation can make it sustaining or disruptive.</p>

<p>I also like the Tesla example. It shows the difficulty faced when entering a market with new technology/innovation deployed in a sustainable manner. Tesla isn&rsquo;t a tech company or disrupting the market. They are a car manufacturer in competition with other car manufacturers.</p>

<p>And as much as I like Tesla for what they did for electric driving<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, I do see many challenges in keeping ahead of the competition while solving the scalability issues they are facing.</p>

<p>Entering a market with a sustainable innovation is a rat race. And this is no different for Tesla.
So how much time does it take Tesla to get their production efficiency on par with the traditional car manufactures? And how long will it take those manufactures to get to the same technology level?</p>

<p><em>Keeping in mind that traditional manufacturers very likely will be able to buy their way into newer and better technology at an increasing pace. Taking into account that there are a growing number of potential suppliers for self-driving tech (who haven&rsquo;t shown interest in mass producing cars)</em>.</p>

<p>With every minute passing it will be easier for those traditional manufacturers to add more advanced technology into the already established line up of cars (which already are built at a massive scale).</p>

<p>So the biggest problem faced by Tesla isn&rsquo;t how to build cars at scale. Given enough time I&rsquo;m sure they will figure this out, other companies already have done so.</p>

<p>But the challenge for Tesla is keeping their edge over the competition. Keep outpacing other car manufacturers on a technology front long enough. Making the most innovative cars and reaching the hearts&amp;minds (and share of wallets) from their potential customer. Which in turn will buy them (much needed) time to sort out car production at scale.</p>

<p>And if Tesla succeeds I still wonder what will differentiate Tesla when the rest of the market obtains the same level of technology.</p>

<p>You are basically betting on your ability to innovate at a faster pace then the incumbents can play catch up when competing on technology in a sustaining business model.</p>

<p>Which is all well and good, but clearly very different from disruption.
Self-driving technology will make ride-sharing services cheap, practical and maybe even irresistible to consumers that they (potentially) will just stop buying cars altogether. Which would be very disruptive to the current market.</p>

<p>If this will happen at all, no one can tell. But I know that although innovative we shouldn&rsquo;t be calling Tesla disruptive anymore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/04/17/musk-tesla">quoting a quote of Eldon Musk by John Gruber</a>.</p>

<p>But after reading the article and memo I can&rsquo;t suppress the feeling that people waiting in line (after forking over cash to enter the cue) would be happy with clear delivery times<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and quite satisfied with tolerances on par with current electric cars that are already build at scale<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In my opinion the real challenge for Tesla (or any car manufacture for that matter) isn&rsquo;t reaching near perfect build precision but getting to a good enough level <em>at scale</em>.</p>

<p>Tesla taking on the challenge to build 350.000+ model 3&rsquo;s currently in backorder<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> is a marvel on it&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>The whole article feels a bit shortsighted and only focussing on comparing the iPad to a regular PC. All of the statements could be made in favour of the iPad as a PC replacement. It&rsquo;s all about perspective I guess.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> users wanting to use a custom domain name for their hosted Micro.blog will be greeted by a <code>“custom domain isn't pointing to the micro.blog&quot;</code> error message when trying to save the custom domain.</p>

<p>Luckily there is a work around:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-your-custom-domain-working-with-cloudflare">How to get your custom domain working <em>with</em> Cloudflare</h2>

<ol>
<li>First follow the steps as outlined above and add the proper “A” and/or “CNAME” records to the Cloudflare DNS panel;</li>
<li>Before adding the custom domain to your Micro.blog account make sure that the “DNS and HTTP proxy (CDN)”  (orange cloud-icon) is disabled and set to bypass (grey cloud icon with the hover text “DNS only”);</li>
<li>After updating your DNS records and Cloudflare set to bypass for the “A” record and/or “CNAME” go to “Account” on Micro.blog  and fill hostname (e.g. yourdomain.com) that you’d like to use for your Micro.blog;</li>
<li>Micro.blog should save and enable to custom domain without issues. <em>If you get a message “custom domain isn&rsquo;t pointing to the micro.blog&rdquo;</em> make sure that you have set Cloudflare on bypass and wait for a few more minutes (the DNS change can take some time to get in effect);</li>
<li>After successful saving the custom domain you can re-enable Cloudflare functionality on your domain/Micro.blog by remove the bypass, make sure that the cloud-icon is set to orange (hover text should state: “DNS and HTTP proxy (CDN)”).</li>
</ol>

<p><em>So there you have it, you are able to use  Cloudflare (DNS/CDN/security/caching/DDOS protection) with hosted Micro.blogs, with some  additional steps to get the initial setup working.</em></p>

<h2 id="some-additional-recommendations">Some additional recommendations:</h2>

<h3 id="using-cloudflare-to-redirect-www-to-root-domain">Using Cloudflare to redirect www. to root domain</h3>

<p>If you would like to enable www. and root version of your custom domain it’s advisable to redirect one to the other (to make sure that there isn’t any duplicated content). Cloudflare can redirect the www. version to the root domain:
1. Go to “Page rules” within your Cloudflare account;
2. Create a page rule;
3. Add &lt;www.yourdomain.com&gt;/* within the first field (“If the URL matches”);
4. Under “Then the settings are:” select “Forwarding URL”, “ 301 - Permanent redirect”;
5. Add: &lt;yourdomain.com&gt;/$1 to the destination URL field;
6. Save and deploy the page rule for the redirect to take effect.</p>

<h3 id="cloudflare-ssl-and-your-micro-blog">Cloudflare, SSL and your Micro.blog</h3>

<p>You should not use the SSL functionality provided by Cloudflare (email help@micro.blog to enable SSL).</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I switched my theme for this microblog to Marfa.</p>

<p>Marfa is a new theme for <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> hosted websites. I really like the theme but wanted to give it a small personal touch by changing the default color for links.</p>

<p>Changing the defaults (light red/pink-ish) is quite easy.
Using the edit CSS functionality of Micro.blog you can overwrite the default colors by pasting the code above and change the colors to your liking.</p>

<pre><code class="language-CSS">nav.main-nav a.cta {
	background: #fff;
	color: #ee4792;
	border: 2px solid #fcdae9;
}

nav.main-nav a.cta:hover {
	background: #fcdae9;
	color: #ee4792;
}

nav.main-nav a, #footer a, #post-nav a, p a{
   box-shadow: inset 0 -2px 0 #fcdae9;
}

nav.main-nav a:hover, #footer a:hover, #post-nav a:hover, p a:hover {
	box-shadow: inset 0 -25px 0 #fcdae9;
}
</code></pre>

<p><em><code>#fcdae9</code> is for underline and shading of the links. The <code>#ee4792</code> color is for the “Also on Micro.blog” text in the upper right button.</em></p>

         	<p>Mark Zuckerberg left some of his notes on the table during a break in his testimony before Congress yesterday. It caught the attention of a press photographer who shared a photo of the document on social media.</p>

<p>I guess Mark learned an important lesson: never to leave your notes open and unattended in public. Keeping stuff to yourself should not be based solely on trusting others to act in your best interest.</p>

<p>There is, however, quite some talk on social media if it&rsquo;s morally ok for the press to share the picture taken.

         	<p>Questioning if I really need to look in to switching Text editors I almost discarding the <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-text-editor-macos/">pick for the best Text Editor over at The Sweet Setup</a>. Although after quickly skimming the article, some part did caught my attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Atom, being open source, has an advantage here compared to other options like Sublime Text or BBEdit.</p>

<p>Even if GitHub were to stop actively developing Atom, the open source nature of the app would (probably) allow it to live on through collaboration of its users and other contributors. In that sense, Atom is about as future-proof as an app can be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being open source and supported by a community sparked my interest (mainly due to my renewed focus on IndieWeb / Open standards and Open source). So, a bit to my surprise, I am now switching text editors.</p>

<p>Unavoidable as it seems, though, this approach has two problems. First, getting that sample ‘right’ is very hard, and beset by all sorts of conceptual challenges. But second, even if it’s a successful sample, it’s still a sample.</p>

<p>Using signals of what people seem to want to see risks over-fitting, circularity and filter bubbles. People’s desires change, and they get bored of things.</p>
