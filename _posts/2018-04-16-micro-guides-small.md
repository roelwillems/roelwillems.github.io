Yesterday I had the opportunity to help someone from the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) community by writing a [tiny post](http://roelwillems.com/2018/04/15/i-switched-my.html). 

This sparked an idea: *Micro guides*, small articles about any subject you think could be of help or interest to the Microblogging community (for instance on writing, podcasting[^1], blog design or any other subject you think could be of help).

I will certainly start to share more short articles on my journey to writing more often and possibly on Micro.blog tech stuff if I run in to it.

The open web is build together, feel free to share (who knows how many people you could help!)

[^1]:I already learned a lot about podcasting from the people I follow.
