> "In recent years, we’ve seen our rich universe of diverse, creative blogs and sites implode—leaving fewer and fewer channels available to new voices. As more content centralizes into a handful of all-powerful networks, there’s a dreary sameness in perspective and presentation. .... This creeping monopolization is a sad echo of how media worked in the 20th century. It doesn’t reflect 21st century diversity and empowerment. It’s not the web’s promise. It’s not how it’s supposed to be." 

[A list apart](https://alistapart.com/article/new-a-list-apart-wants-you)

I couldn't agree more to this statement. With some centralized players growing more  powerfull with each day passing, it's more important to support diversity, independent content creation and keep ownership of your content.
