1Blocker will be releasing a new version called [1Blocker X](https://backstage.1blocker.com/say-hello-to-1blocker-x-8b55efe1ae36) on 26 April, [pre-order now available](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1365531024?at=1l3v36d). I have no doubt it will be even better than the original (now called 1Blocker Legacy), so Iâ€™m in.
