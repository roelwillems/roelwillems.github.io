>Still, the lasting appeal of RSS remains the parts that haven't changed: the unfiltered view of the open web, and the chance to make your own decisions about what you find there.

_[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/)_ 

It's great to see a recent uptake in RSS popularity. In my opinion RSS is one of the most valuable tools of the internet. 
And although probably not growing in new users for quite some time, for people still onboard, including myself, RSS never stopt providing it's value.

Being a open standard really proves itâ€™s value _and_ resilience.

_If someone is looking a basic but dependable RSS service I can recommend Miniflux._
