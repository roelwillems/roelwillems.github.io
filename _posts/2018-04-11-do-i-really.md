Questioning if I really need to look in to switching Text editors I almost discarding the [pick for the best Text Editor over at The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-text-editor-macos/). After quickly skimming the article, some part really caught my attention.

>Atom, being open source, has an advantage here compared to other options like Sublime Text or BBEdit.

>Even if GitHub were to stop actively developing Atom, the open source nature of the app would (probably) allow it to live on through collaboration of its users and other contributors. In that sense, Atom is about as future-proof as an app can be.

It really sparked my interest (mainly due to my renewed focus on IndieWeb / Open standards and Open source). So, to my surprise, I am now switching text editors.
