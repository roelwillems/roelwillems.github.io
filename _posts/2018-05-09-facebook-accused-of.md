[The Telegraph article](https://www..co.uk/news/2018/05/05/facebook-accused-introducing-extremists-one-another-suggested/)[^1].

There is much to say about the role and responsibility of Facebook. But I couldn't think of a comment as brilliant as the one by [@ben](https://micro.blog/ben) [->](https://brooksreview.net/2018/05/facebook-accused-of-introducing-extremists-to-one-another-through-suggested-friends-feature/).
