> Most of the design tolerances of the Model 3 are already better than any other car in the world. Soon, they will all be better. This is not enough. We will keep going until the Model 3 build precision is a factor of ten better than any other car in the world. I am not kidding.

> Our car needs to be designed and built with such accuracy and precision that, if an owner measures dimensions, panel gaps and flushness, and their measurements donâ€™t match the Model 3 specs, it just means that their measuring tape is wrong.

I'm [quoting a quote of Eldon Musk by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/04/17/musk-tesla). 

But after reading the article and memo I can't suppress the feeling that people waiting in line (after forking over cash to enter the cue) would be happy with clear delivery times[^1] and quite satisfied with tolerances on par with current electric cars that are already build at scale[^2].

In my opinion the real challenge for Tesla (or any car manufacture for that matter) isn't reaching near perfect build precision but getting to a good enough level _at scale_.

Tesla taking on the challenge to build 350.000+ model 3's currently in backorder[^3] is a marvel on it's own.

This will play out to be the greatest achievement in automotive history or Tesla being overtaken by the [traditional manufactures moving to full electric](https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-to-phase-out-conventional-car-engine-14992272020).
