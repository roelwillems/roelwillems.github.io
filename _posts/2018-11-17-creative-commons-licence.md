Redid the footer of my website and am quite happy with the result. 

Also moved to a creative commons licence for my content (the "Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)" to be precise) which gives everyone the freedom to remix, reuse and build upon the content shared (with appropriate credit and indication if changes were made).[^1]

Although I don't expect many people to use my content, consider it my contributions to a free and open internet.

[^1]:Although I believe it would be a good thing for the internet and it's users if more people would move to more open licences, please do make sure to really understand the implications to determine if a licence is right for you. [Read all about it ](https://creativecommons.org)
