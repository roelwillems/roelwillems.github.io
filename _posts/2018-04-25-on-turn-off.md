Nathan Toups makes a case for a [dumber phone](https://nomasters.io/posts/dumber-phone/) with great recommendations overall. 

One thing I would add from personal experience[^1] is to make very conscious use of the silence/mute switch on phone. 

No sound/viberation 99% of the time, but if I need and enable sound it also have the super annoying keyboard sounds enabled (so I don’t forget to revert to silent _ASAP_).

[^1]:Personally I turned off sounds and vibration on my phone when I started wearing my Apple Watch.  Now I’m back to wearing a classic watch as wrist based notifications [over time became an unwanted distraction](http://roelwillems.com/2018/04/10/the-battery-of.html).
