>For 20 years or so, there has been the debate over whether you should use www or not in your web site’s canonical hostname. So should you use www or not?

[To www or not to www – Should you use www or not in your domain? by Bjørn Johansen](https://bjornjohansen.no/www-or-not) 

Great read on the pro’s (prettier and easier) vs cons (security regarding cookies) of using www. For my own domain I don’t use cookies (besides one Cloudflare load balancing cookie), so using the origin domain without www. is perfectly safe. But still I wonder, should I switch just to support proper and safe web techniques?
