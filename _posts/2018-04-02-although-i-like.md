Although I like Cloudflare, I'm not sure what to think regarding there recent news regarding their own [DNS service](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/). 

I do think it’ great that they bring an alternative DNS service (with great performance and seemingly a strong focus on privacy). But I have some reservations regarding centralising DNS at a company which already controls 80% of the western internet.
