    <div class="content post e-content">
      <p>Mark Zuckerberg left some of his notes on the table during a break in his testimony before Congress yesterday. It caught the attention of a press photographer who shared a photo of the document on social media.</p>

<p>I guess Mark learned an important lesson: never to leave your notes open and unattended in public. Keeping stuff to yourself should not be based solely on trusting others to act in your best interest.</p>

<p>To reuse and rephrase a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">quote by Mr. Zuckerberg himself</a>; <em>‘I’ve “trust them.” Dumb f*ck’</em></p>

<p>There is, however, quite some talk on social media if it’s morally ok for the press to share the picture taken.  A valid discussion even when it’s a hearing regarding a company under testimony for violating people’s privacy. We should Tteat others as you would want them to treat you<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <div class="content post e-content">
      <p>Questioning if I really need to look in to switching Text editors I almost discarding the <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-text-editor-macos/">pick for the best Text Editor over at The Sweet Setup</a>. After quickly skimming the article, some part really caught my attention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Atom, being open source, has an advantage here compared to other options like Sublime Text or BBEdit.</p>

  <p>Even if GitHub were to stop actively developing Atom, the open source nature of the app would (probably) allow it to live on through collaboration of its users and other contributors. In that sense, Atom is about as future-proof as an app can be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really sparked my interest (mainly due to my renewed focus on IndieWeb / Open standards and Open source). So, to my surprise, I am now switching text editors.</p>

      <p>Benedict Evans in his article “The death of the newsfeed” very clearly provides insight on why big tech companies are forced to a more algorithmic world, inadvertently forcing them between a rock and a hard place.</p>

<p>I couldn’t agree more to all Benedict states in this article and highly recommend anyone interested in this subject to read the article (twice!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unavoidable as it seems, though, this approach has two problems. First, getting that sample ‘right’ is very hard, and beset by all sorts of conceptual challenges. But second, even if it’s a successful sample, it’s still a sample.</p>

  <p>Using signals of what people seem to want to see risks over-fitting, circularity and filter bubbles. People’s desires change, and they get bored of things.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is one of the biggest challenges in data science.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/">Wired</a></em></p>

<p>It’s great to see a recent uptake in RSS popularity. In my opinion RSS is one of the most valuable tools of the internet. 
And although probably not growing in new users for quite some time, for people still onboard, including myself, RSS never stopt providing it’s value.</p>

<p>Being a open standard really proves it’s value <em>and</em> resilience.</p>

for most Internet users, when they connect to an ISP, or a coffee shop wifi hot spot, or a mobile network then the network operator will dictate what DNS resolver to use.
…
The problem is that these DNS services are often slow and not privacy respecting.</p>

<p>Although I like Cloudflare, I’m not sure what to think regarding there recent news regarding their own <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">DNS service</a>.</p>

<p>I do think it’ great that they bring an alternative DNS service (with great performance and seemingly a strong focus on privacy). But I have some reservations regarding centralising DNS at a company which already controls 80% of the western internet.</p>

      <p>“In recent years, we’ve seen our rich universe of diverse, creative blogs and sites implode—leaving fewer and fewer channels available to new voices. As more content centralizes into a handful of all-powerful networks, there’s a dreary sameness in perspective and presentation. …. This creeping monopolization is a sad echo of how media worked in the 20th century. It doesn’t reflect 21st century diversity and empowerment. It’s not the web’s promise. It’s not how it’s supposed to be.”</p>

<p><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/new-a-list-apart-wants-you">A list apart</a></p>

<p>I couldn’t agree more to this statement. With some centralized players growing more  powerfull with each day passing, it’s more important to support diversity, independent content creation and keep ownership of your content.</p>
