			"content_html": "<p>I like words. I like plain and simple thoughts and stories written down. \nFor as long as the internet existed it has been a great place to read and write.</p>\n\n<p>But while the web has been ever increasingly gaining advancements in design and complexity, I value… no, I crave, simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>Almost all of the web today is geared toward gaining attention and <em>eyeballs</em>. Every year, with every advancement, I feel we distance ourselves more and more from what is really valuable for these mere <em>eyeballs</em> (also known as humans).</p>\n\n<p>At most websites, you have to click through a jungle of stuff which only distracts from their main objective (just to name a few: Medium, Youtube and almost all news outlets on the web).\nAnd although I fully understand the business objectives driving these decisions, I feel there is a quality to simplicity and not being over-designed. In my opinion, it adds character.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time your message will not be more clearly expressed when surrounded by fancy stuff let alone a bombardment of ads and messages.</p>\n\n<p>Plain words on a plain website are in my opinion just like a vinyl record. And just like for people enjoy listening to a vinyl record, it’s not about audio perfection or having all bells and whistles. It’s completely the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>To take the music analogy a step future. A super clean production of a mediocre song can become a hit (with the right number of infuencers and paid-airtime), but be all forgotten about in a year or so. “Perfection” gets boring most often.\nThe song that an artist (possibly with less vocal quality or marketing budget) just had to put out there has the potential to become legendary. Because it has meaning and its roughness only adds to its quality.</p>\n\n<p>With words, like music, it’s also not about perfection but about meaning.</p>\n\n<p>When writing we should feel like an artist making a song. Making a song, not because it will show our vocal capabilities best, but because it’s a song that has to be made, has to be heard.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for words, the beauty is in meaning. Just feel free to write.</p>\n\n<p><em>This post is as much reminding myself that my writing doesn’t have to be perfect as supporting everyone reading this to just write down what you feel you have to say!</em></p>\n",

Since I was a new user, the website decided that it needed to check that I wasn’t a robot and so set me a Captcha (Completely Automated Public <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test\">Turing test</a> to tell Computers and Humans Apart). This is a challenge-response test to enable a computer to determine whether the user is a person rather than a machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<!-- -->\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But note also the delicious additional irony that the Captcha is described as an “automated Turing test”. The Turing test was conceived, you may recall, as a way of enabling humans to determine whether a machine could respond in such a way that one couldn’t tell whether it was a human or a robot. So we have wandered into a topsy-turvy world in which machines make us jump through hoops to prove that we are humans!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although it’s clearly human ingenuity transforming us to unpaid “click workers” training A.I, but regardless it’s still a very interesting case.</p>\n\n<p>It makes you wonder what could happen if an A.I. would learn and deploy this on its own. And although I don’t think this would happen in the very near future, we should think about unforeseen consequences (as almost all technology and legislations bring in there wake).</p>\n\n<p><em>P.S. Personally I find the types of CAPTCHAs presented to us very interesting. It gives insight in the current focus of developments in machine learning and A.I. Will be very interesting to see what will be next after road signs and store fronts.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2018/nov/18/computers-have-learned-to-make-us-jump-through-hoops\">Computers have learned to make us jump through hoops</a> - The Guardian</p>\n",
