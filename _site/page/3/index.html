        <p>I like words. I like plain and simple thoughts and stories written down. 
For as long as the internet existed it has been a great place to read and write.</p>

<p>But while the web has been ever increasingly gaining advancements in design and complexity, I value… no, I crave, simplicity.</p>

<p>Almost all of the web today is geared toward gaining attention and <em>eyeballs</em>. Every year, with every advancement, I feel we distance ourselves more and more from what is really valuable for these mere <em>eyeballs</em> (also known as humans).</p>

<p>At most websites, you have to click through a jungle of stuff which only distracts from their main objective (just to name a few: Medium, Youtube and almost all news outlets on the web).
And although I fully understand the business objectives driving these decisions, I feel there is a quality to simplicity and not being over-designed. In my opinion, it adds character.</p>

<p>Most of the time your message will not be more clearly expressed when surrounded by fancy stuff let alone a bombardment of ads and messages.</p>

<p>Plain words on a plain website are in my opinion just like a vinyl record. And just like for people enjoy listening to a vinyl record, it’s not about audio perfection or having all bells and whistles. It’s completely the opposite.</p>

<p>To take the music analogy a step future. A super clean production of a mediocre song can become a hit (with the right number of infuencers and paid-airtime), but be all forgotten about in a year or so. “Perfection” gets boring most often.
The song that an artist (possibly with less vocal quality or marketing budget) just had to put out there has the potential to become legendary. Because it has meaning and its roughness only adds to its quality.</p>

<p>With words, like music, it’s also not about perfection but about meaning.</p>

<p>When writing we should feel like an artist making a song. Making a song, not because it will show our vocal capabilities best, but because it’s a song that has to be made, has to be heard.</p>

<p>The same goes for words, the beauty is in meaning. Just feel free to write.</p>

<p><em>This post is as much reminding myself that my writing doesn’t have to be perfect as supporting everyone reading this to just write down what you feel you have to say!</em></p>

  <p>In a Tuesday interview with CNN, Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook’s handling of recent scandals and his own leadership of the company. He flatly rejected calls to give up his position as the chairman of Facebook’s board and said he had no plans to fire his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg.</p>

  <p>People like to mock Google’s “don’t be evil” slogan, but the company really has made difficult calls in the past—like pulling out of China over pressure to build a censored search engine.</p>

  <p>By contrast, Facebook only seems to care about promoting the continued growth of Facebook.</p>

<p>The inability of Facebook to change after an increasing number of incedents and scandals is shocking. Although Google shouldn’t be presented as a poster boy, the differences does show. Talk the talk … walk the walk</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>The other day I had to log in to a service I hadn’t used before. Since I was a new user, the website decided that it needed to check that I wasn’t a robot and so set me a Captcha (Completely Automated Public <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> to tell Computers and Humans Apart). This is a challenge-response test to enable a computer to determine whether the user is a person rather than a machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->
<blockquote>
  <p>But note also the delicious additional irony that the Captcha is described as an “automated Turing test”. The Turing test was conceived, you may recall, as a way of enabling humans to determine whether a machine could respond in such a way that one couldn’t tell whether it was a human or a robot. So we have wandered into a topsy-turvy world in which machines make us jump through hoops to prove that we are humans!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it’s clearly human ingenuity transforming us to unpaid “click workers” training A.I, but regardless it’s still a very interesting case.</p>

<p>It makes you wonder what could happen if an A.I. would learn and deploy this on its own. And although I don’t think this would happen in the very near future, we should think about unforeseen consequences (as almost all technology and legislations bring in there wake).</p>

<p><em>P.S. Personally I find the types of CAPTCHAs presented to us very interesting. It gives insight in the current focus of developments in machine learning and A.I. Will be very interesting to see what will be next after road signs and store fronts.</em></p>

<p>Great read on the pro’s (prettier and easier) vs cons (security regarding cookies) of using www. For my own domain I don’t use cookies (besides one Cloudflare load balancing cookie), so using the origin domain without www. is perfectly safe. But still I wonder, should I switch just to support proper and safe web techniques?</p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/11/18/getting-your-hosted.html">Micro guide: Getting your hosted Microblog IPv6 ready</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>This is a small guide (hence the category <a href="https://roelwillems.com/micro-guides/">“micro guide”</a>) to enable IPv6<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> for your hosted microblog<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>disclaimer: please make sure that you know what you are doing with your DNS settings. Although it isn’t really difficult or complex you can really mess up access to your website if the settings are incorrect. Please make note of the original settings before changing anything.</em></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-ipv6">Setting up IPv6</h3>
<p>To start, you should go to your domain registrar or system to manage DNS (personally I use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> and have written another micro guide with recommendations on how-to <a href="https://roelwillems.com/2018/04/16/micro-guide-additional.html">enable Cloudflare for your microblog</a>).</p>

<p>Now you can create an AAAA record (a record is an instruction for the browser to which server to connect and the AAAA version is used for IPv6 addresses).</p>

<p>Make sure that the AAAA record is pointing to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>2600:3c00:1::68c8:16d6
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is the IPv6 address for hosted microblogs.
Leave the A record (address for IPv4) and other records like CNAME unaltered. Based on you DNS provider it should look somewhat like:</p>

<p><img src="https://roelwillems.com/uploads/2018/99b7b82333.png" alt="example of DNS records" /></p>

<p>Save the settings and after a few minutes you can <a href="https://www.internet.nl">check if your website has support for IPv6</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/05/02/disruptive-vs-sustaining.html">Disruptive vs Sustaining innovation and the Tesla case</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I always enjoy Ben en James talking business strategy in their <a href="http://exponent.fm">Exponent podcast</a> (Ben Thompson from <a href="https://stratechery.com">Stratechery</a> with co-host James Allworth). Their last podcast about Zillow (<a href="http://exponent.fm/episode-149-zillow-and-sustaining-aggregation/">#149 - Zillow and Sustaining Aggregation</a>) has a specific part really standing out. At 14:14 minutes in, James explains the difference between sustaining and disrupting innovation. And does so in very clear language.</p>

<p>An excerpt from the podcast (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>James: It think what would be interesting here, just to drive home the point for people. Is to think about a technology right now and how it could be applied as a sustaining innovation and a disruptive innovation. It’s been a less popular topic in the more recent Exponents but obviously, if you go back far enough, something we would talk a whole lot about is self-driving cars and the impact that’s going to have on society.</p>

  <p>Now the technology is going to be the same if you are an existing manufacturer or something like Google, and maybe Google drops it into an existing manufacturer. This is a technology in and of itself business model agnostic, but you think about the incentives of different players and how they want to apply that technology. You give this to someone like BMW, an existing car manufacturer. And their instinct is to think; how can I take this technology and sell the vehicle that I have for more money as a result. And you get cool features like self-driving on Tesla or adaptive cruise control on BMW. <em>………</em> But it’s fundamentally a sustaining innovation. This is exactly why self-driving vehicle; people love to talk about Tesla’s disruptive, and maybe there is something in terms of the way they are thinking about building out a network and so on, this is true. But in terms of the actual vehicles, this is why Tesla vehicles are fundamentally not a disruptive product. <em>They are using a technology to sell a better product to the existing people for more money. It is fundamentally the same business model.</em> But take that to a very different context which is; <em>something like Uber or Lift, doing ride sharing. And their primary cost of business is paying for the drivers in the vehicles. And that is disruptive to the existing car manufacturers. Uber and lift want to take the self-driving technology and they are not going to take that and trying to sell the vehicles for more money as a result of it.</em> They are going to take the technology and use it to drive down the cost basis of offering ride sharing. <em>The same technology applied in fundamentally different ways, one is sustaining, one is disruptive.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Highly recommend listing if you care about online/tech business strategy. 
James (and Ben) make a very compelling case that most (new) tech companies still running sustaining business models and most of them are in fact are no disrupters at all. Even if popular media will consistently describe them as “disruptive”.</p>

<p>Tesla is also a great explanatory case for disruption vs sustaining business models. The technology deployed by Tesla is very new (and Eldon’s vision maybe futuristic) but in its basic form, Tesla tries to build (better) cars and sell them for profit.</p>

<p>My personal take out is: technology in and on itself isn’t disruptive, the way technology is applied and to be more precise; the business model around it, make it disruptive for the status quo. 
Based on the business model behind technology/innovation can make it sustaining or disruptive.</p>

<p>I also like the Tesla example. It shows the difficulty faced when entering a market with new technology/innovation deployed in a sustainable manner. Tesla isn’t a tech company or disrupting the market. They are a car manufacturer in competition with other car manufacturers.</p>

<p>And as much as I like Tesla for what they did for electric driving<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, I do see many challenges in keeping ahead of the competition while solving the scalability issues they are facing.</p>

<p>Entering a market with a sustainable innovation is a rat race. And this is no different for Tesla.
So how much time does it take Tesla to get their production efficiency on par with the traditional car manufactures? And how long will it take those manufactures to get to the same technology level?</p>

<p><em>Keeping in mind that traditional manufacturers very likely will be able to buy their way into newer and better technology at an increasing pace. Taking into account that there are a growing number of potential suppliers for self-driving tech (who haven’t shown interest in mass producing cars)</em>.</p>

<p>With every minute passing it will be easier for those traditional manufacturers to add more advanced technology into the already established line up of cars (which already are built at a massive scale).</p>

<p>So the biggest problem faced by Tesla isn’t how to build cars at scale. Given enough time I’m sure they will figure this out, other companies already have done so.</p>

<p>But the challenge for Tesla is keeping their edge over the competition. Keep outpacing other car manufacturers on a technology front long enough. Making the most innovative cars and reaching the hearts&amp;minds (and share of wallets) from their potential customer. Which in turn will buy them (much needed) time to sort out car production at scale.</p>

<p>And if Tesla succeeds I still wonder what will differentiate Tesla when the rest of the market obtains the same level of technology.</p>

<p>You are basically betting on your ability to innovate at a faster pace then the incumbents can play catch up when competing on technology in a sustaining business model.</p>

<p>Which is all well and good, but clearly very different from disruption. 
Self-driving technology will make ride-sharing services cheap, practical and maybe even irresistible to consumers that they (potentially) will just stop buying cars altogether. Which would be very disruptive to the current market.</p>

<p>If this will happen at all, no one can tell. But I know that although innovative we shouldn’t be calling Tesla disruptive anymore.</p>
