Welcome to my blog. 

Iâ€™m Roel Willems,

This is my own space on the internet and used as a poster wall of all I find interesting online. This could be about online business and internet culture but likely you will find random posts, quotes and link posts on technology, personal development, data &amp; online privacy and other topics which spark my interest.

I work at Albert Heijn Online (part of Ahold Delhaize) leading the analytics, data science and experimentation team. 

For analytics, data science and Experimentation focused content please visit [Eliminateguess.work](eliminateguess.work).

You can find my Photography at [maintainingfocus.com](maintaining focus.com).
