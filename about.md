Welcome to my blog. 

Iâ€™m Roel Willems,

This is my own space on the internet and used as a poster wall of all I find interesting online. This could be about online business and internet culture but likely you will find random posts, quotes and link posts on technology, personal development, data & online privacy and other topics which spark my interest.

I work at Albert Heijn Online (part of Ahold Delhaize) leading the analytics, data science and experimentation team. 

For analytics, data science and Experimentation focused content please visit [Eliminateguess.work](https://eliminateguess.work). (moving the content is work in progress)

You can find my photography at [maintainingfocus.com](https://maintainingfocus.com).

_A few additional words:_
- all views and opinions expressed are my own;
- Recommendations to services, apps or companies are without any affiliation (or otherwise explicitly disclosed).
