Welcome to my blog. 

Iâ€™m Roel Willems, I work as lead analytics, data science and experimentation at Albert Heijn Online (part of Ahold Delhaize). And use Analytics, Data Science &amp; Experimentation to eliminate guesswork.

This is my own space and used as a poster wall of all I find interesting online. This could be about online business and internet culture but likely you will find random posts, quotes and link posts on all regarding technology, data science, online privacy and other topics which spark my interest.

_A few additional words:_
- all views and opinions expressed are my own;
- Recommendations to services, apps or companies are without any affiliation.
